Step 1: Save convert.py into the same folder as your .mbtiles file
Step 2: Make sure python is installed
Step 3: In terminal, cd into that folder
Step 4: Run this:

python convert.py filename.mbtiles

That's it! It should generate a folder called filename filled with PNGs that contain the data in the mbtiles archive.

Caveat: I understand that some mbtiles files have JPGs, not PNG. I haven't bothered to detect that yet, though. I just write all of the files with a .png extension.
